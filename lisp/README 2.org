* This Directory
This directory and all of these lisp files are what comprise the Configure.org
file. Originally, there was just a stand-alone init.el that had a bunch of
=require= functions to pull from this directory. While nice and neat, it
wasn't as easy, IMHO, as just editing an ORG file.

Since the ORG file can consist of several different bullet levels which can
also be collapsed, it made it easy to get sections of code out of the way but
yet still easy to get to. So, I decided that instead of a bunch of separate
init-* files, to instead just use ORG mode and the Configure.org file.

However, with that said, I still think it's worth keeping this diectory and
all of it's files around in the event that I want to either:

  * Go back to the old way of an init.el with a bunch of =require= statements
  * Use an init-* file in the case where it really is too unwieldy in the
    Configure.org file
